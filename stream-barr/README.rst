Stream Benchmark with Barriers
----------------

The stream benchmark is part of the HPC Challenge benchmarks (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/).
Here we present a version that inserts barriers. The behavior of this version with barriers
resembles the OpenMP version, where the different functions (Copy, Scale, ...) are executed 
one after another for the whole array.
